Since April of last year, I've been organizing the
<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/6036">Drupal NYC Happy Hour</a>.
The idea is very simple, and one that I admittedly got from the
<a href="http://groups.drupal.org/twin-cities">Twin Citites group</a>. Get
a bunch of drupalers together to have a few drinks, with no other agenda.
This simple concept has proven to be wildly popular, and we regularly see crowds
of around 50 drupalers.

Earlier today, in the #drupalnyc IRC room, kombucha suggested that having a
regularly recurring date for our local Happy Hour may catch on in other groups.
How cool would it be to have a <strong><em>Worldwide Drupal Happy Hour</em></strong>
on the same day every month?

Does your local Drupal group host a similar event?&nbsp; If so, would you
consider changing the date if we could agree on a standard date?
