I just gave 2 talks at Drupal Camp NYC and wanted to make sure to put some links up for people to follow.

The first talk was about multilingual setups. We covered using Drupal 6's built in locale and translation modules, as well as some contrib modules.  Here are a few links to continue that discussion:
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/node/322729">Drupal Handbook: Localization API</a></dt>
<dd>This is a <em>must-read</em> for <em>ANY</em> module developer or themer out there, not just those concerned with internationalization.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/i18n">Internationalization (i18n) module(s)</a></dt>
<dd>The venerable i18n module package, for plugging some of the large gaps left by core.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/l10n_server">Localization Server</a></dt>
<dd>A great tool for doing collaborative localization/translation.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/l10n_client">Localization Client</a></dt>
<dd>Very nice javascript widget for doing on-site translations.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/geoip">GeoIP API module</a></dt>
<dd>This is the module I just released which provides a simple and solid API for GeoIP location</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/google_language">Google Language Tools module</a></dt>
<dd>A nifty little module to do some cool things using the Google Ajax Language Tools.  <em>still very experimental</em></dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/issues/3060/term/301">i18n Sprint issues for Drupal 7</a></dt>
<dd>This is the list of issues tagged before/during the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/18812">i18n code sprint</a>.</dd>
</dl>

The second session was about advanced multisite setups.  The main focus of this talk was about how to set up a multisite environment and how install profiles can automate much of the work of creating similar sites in a multisite setup.

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/getting-started/5/install/multi-site">Drupal Handbook: Multi-site</a></dt>
<dd>This is the drupal handbook page for multi-site.  It is writting for Drupal 5, but is still relevant for Drupal 6.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/installation+profiles">Drupal.org contributed Installation Profiles</a></dt>
<dd>There are several contributed installation profiles.  Find one that suits your needs or use one as a base for your own custom installer.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://drupal.org/project/install_profile_api">Install Profile API module</a></dt>
<dd>This module is a huge help when building install profiles. It provides CRUD functions for building common Drupal structures like nodes, users, roles, profiles, etc...</dd>
