I've been hard at work lately on my new pet project, the 
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/dialog">Dialog API</a> module. My goal for 
this module is simple. Take the incredibly simple CTools ajax command framework, 
and merry it to the jQuery UI Dialog widget, to provide an incredibly simple api 
for creating dynamic dialogs. The basis of this module comes from CTools' modal 
framework (which I wrote about <a href="/node/31">previously</a>), so if you've 
used that in the past, using dialog should be a breeze.

Though this project is less than 2 months old, it is starting to gain some 
traction. <a href="http://drupal.org/user/53892">Dave Reid</a> just committed 
support for Dialog to both the 6.x and 7.x branches of 
<a href="http://drupal.org/project/xmlsitemap">XML Sitemap</a>. There is also 
<a href="http://drupal.org/node/690862">an issue in the Skinr queue</a> to use 
Dialog in place of modalframe.
