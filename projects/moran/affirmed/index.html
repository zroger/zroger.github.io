            The unmistakable apprehension that accompanies the dawn of every Derby Day brought
            with it a unique, electric urgency on May 6, 1978. A rivalry that developed between
            the best two-year-olds of 1977, a season that unfolded in the long shadow of the
            still- undefeated Seattle Slew&rsquo;s domi- nance of the Triple Crown, would be reignited
            in full bloom that afternoon in the 104th Kentucky Derby. As if two great forces 
            moved on course toward an inevitably explosive collision, the Derby- morning tension
            was noticeably more dense than usual.

            Thirty years ago, a halcyon decade during which Secretariat and Seattle Slew would leave 
            indelible marks on the history of the Triple Crown and Cannonero II, Riva Ridge, Bold Forbes 
            and Spectacular Bid would fall valiantly a race short of the grail after having won the Derby, 
            two chestnut three-year-olds would resume in the shadow of the Twin Spires what was already 
            a compelling rivalry and take it another stride toward the realm of legend. There had been 
            no rivalry as long nor as hair-raising as that one from which Affirmed and Alydar would emerge 
            from the racing season of 1978 forever joined in the sport&rsquo;s collective consciousness. There 
            has been none since. Nor, in three decades, has there been another winner of the Triple Crown.

            Though they had taken different paths to Churchill Downs that spring, they were familiar to one 
            another, veterans of battles waged at Belmont Park, Saratoga and Laurel. The electricity they 
            generated in those races had been amplified by six months during which they had repaired to 
            neutral corners, one dominant in the East, the other in the West. The Derby was not only the test 
            that would reunite and perhaps define the inseparable chestnut colts,
            <span class="quote">
              it was the most anticipated resumption of an established rivalry in memory.          
            </span> 
            &ldquo;This is no pickin&rsquo; chicken party,&rdquo; Affirmed&rsquo;s trainer, Laz Barrera said that morning. 
            &ldquo;Believe It should run good and I think that Darby Creek Road might be underrated. Sensitive Prince has 
            won all six of his starts and because Allen Jerkens trains him, the horse must be respected. But 
            I think Affirmed has to beat Alydar and it could be as simple as that.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            It was.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cast of characters attached to Affirmed and Alydar meshed perfectly, the supporting cast in what 
            would develop into the most hard-fought series of races in Triple Crown history and conclude with 
            the coronation of the 11th three-year-old since 1919 capable of sweeping the Derby, Preakness and 
            Belmont Stakes. The length-and -a-half that separated Affirmed from the furiously rallying Alydar 
            in the Derby would shrink to a neck two weeks later at Pimlico and a head at the end of 12 furlongs 
            in the Belmont Stakes and among those on the edges of countless seats during those five weeks were a 
            colorful and accomplished cadre of humans blessed with the good fortune to have in their lives two 
            such animals whose fateful paths would cross in 1977 and on in the Derby of the following spring become one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alydar was steeped in Bluegrass, bred by Calumet Farm, then owned by Admiral and Mrs. Eugene Markey, 
            and raced beneath the revered Devil&rsquo;s red and blue silks carried by Whirlaway and Citation to triumphs 
            in the Derby and subsequently the Triple Crown. He was trained by Veitch, Kentucky-born son of Hall of Fame 
            trainer Sylvester Veitch, who would in the summer of 2007 follow his father into that fraternity.
          </p>
        </div>
  
        <div id="section-6" class="section-right">
          <h2 class="affirmed">Affirmed</h2>
          <p>
            Affirmed, conceived in Kentucky, was foaled in Florida, and raced in 
            the pink, black and white silks unmistakably connected to Harbor View 
            Farm and the Wolfsons, Louis, the self-made industrialist, financier 
            and breeder, who was stranger to neither controversy nor the limelight, 
            and his wife, Patrice, daughter of Hall of Fame trainer Hirsch Jacobs. 
            The late, Cuban-born Barrera trained Bold Forbes, winner of the Derby 
            and Belmont Stakes two years before he brought Affirmed to meet his 
            destiny, would be inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1979.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last horse to win the Triple Crown and the horse to which he will 
            be forever connected in legend were also closely related. Alydar was 
            by Raise a Native, Affirmed by Raise a Native&rsquo;s son, Exclusive Native. 
            Raise a Native and Exclusive Native both raced in Wolfson&rsquo;s colors. 
            Both, then, were descendent from Native Dancer, the sire of Raise a 
            Native, who was the first three-year-old hero of the television age 
            and winner of 21 of 22 races, defeated only in the Kentucky Derby of 1953.

            Both riders at the center of the maelstrom were destined for eventual 
            enshrinement in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Jorge Velasquez, the Panamanian 
            veteran who rode Alydar, was a fixture in racing&rsquo;s most important 
            events.  In contrast, Steve Cauthen, 18, was at the time most often 
            described by the word, &ldquo;wunderkind,&rdquo; which if seldom used was succinctly 
            accurate – a child in possession of a master&rsquo;s skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two hours after Affirmed held safe Alydar&rsquo;s rally to win the Derby, 
            the late Bill Leggett, of Sports Illustrated, found Barrera seated in 
            the director&rsquo;s room reflecting upon what he had just witnessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;People say that Steve Cauthen is 18 years old,&rdquo; Barrera began. &ldquo;For a
            while, I believed things like that. But the more I watch him ride, the 
            more I start to think other things. He must be at least 100 years old 
            and maybe he don&rsquo;t come from Walton, Kentucky at all. One night, when 
            all the racing world was sleeping, a small flying saucer landed out in 
            the desert somewhere and he got off. He came to the United States from 
            wherever it was with the coolness of Georgie Woolf, the old iceman. 
            And the talent of the master, Eddie Arcaro. And there was some Shoemaker, too.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Stevie stands by the spaceship and waits three minutes. Horses come 
            from everywhere toward the spaceship. They come out of California and 
            Chicago and New York and they line up and say, &lsquo;Stevie, come be my 
            jockey.&rdquo; Stevie doesn&rsquo;t say anything for a few minutes, then waves his 
            hand for silence. &lsquo;Horses,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I will get to you all eventually. 
            Be patient. I am looking for a special horse, one that can win the 
            Kentucky Derby. 
            <span class="quote">
              You there, big chestnut horse, what is your name?&rsquo; This horse 
              said, &lsquo;Affirmed,&rsquo; and Stevie says, &lsquo;Affirmed, I choose you to be 
              my first Derby winner. We will win in 1978 before a huge crowd and I 
              will put up a ride that people will talk about for years to come.&rsquo; 
            </span>
            And, of course, Stevie did it&rdquo;.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Affirmed won the race in which Alydar made his career debut in 
            June, 1977, when the racing world was transfixed upon Seattle Slew&rsquo;s 
            just completed Triple Crown, the rivalry would not begin to take shape 
            until Alydar defeated Affirmed in the Great American Stakes at Belmont 
            Park.  Affirmed was then sent to California for the Hollywood Juvenile, 
            which he won easily, and returned to Saratoga, where he won the Sanford. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Alydar, meanwhile, remained in New York for the Tremont and traveled 
            to nearby Monmouth Park for the Sapling. He won both. Perhaps the 
            greatest equine rivalry of all time began building momentum at Saratoga, 
            where Affirmed defeated Alydar by a half-length in the Hopeful Stakes, 
            then returned to Belmont and beat the Calumet colt again in the Futurity. 
            After their first meeting, in which Alydar finished fifth, no other 
            horse would finish better than third in any race in which both were entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            That autumn, Alydar turned the tables at Belmont, defeating Affirmed 
            in the Champagne Stakes then lost a neck decision to his rival in the 
            Laurel Futurity, which tilted the two-year-old championship in favor 
            of the Harbor View colt after Alydar was upset by Believe It in the 
            Remsen at Aqueduct. Neither would be defeated at age three before 
            reaching Louisville. Barrera took Affirmed to California, where he won 
            an allowance race, the San Felipe, Santa Anita Derby and Hollywood 
            Derby before being shipped to Churchill Downs. Veitch wintered at 
            Hialeah Park, in Florida, where Alydar won an allowance race, the 
            Flamingo Stakes and Florida Derby before moving on to Keeneland to win 
            the Blue Grass, run at the time ten days in advance of the Derby.

            America&rsquo;s Last Triple Crown Winner Breaks<br/>
            from the Gate in the 1978 Kentucky Derby

        <div id="section-8" class="section-left">
          <p>
            When they arrived at the starting gate in Louisville, 10 furlongs 
            from history, Alydar was the 6-5 favorite, the last time he would 
            enjoy that distinction when facing Affirmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rivalry only gained dramatic momentum after the Derby as Affirmed 
            swept the Triple Crown with another white knuckle survival of Alydar&rsquo;s 
            late run in the Preakness and prevailed in a breathless pitched battle 
            in the Belmont Stakes in which they ran head-to-head for almost a mile 
            after which Cauthen would say:
            <span class="quote">
              &ldquo;It would have broken the hearts of some horses, but Alydar kept 
              trying. &ldquo;Jorge set his horse down, I set mine down. Mine won.&rdquo;
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Their rivalry transcended the sport&rsquo;s most important races and lives 
            on, embedded in racing&rsquo;s collective memory. Affirmed finished in front 
            of Alydar in eight of their 10 meetings, though the Calumet colt was 
            placed first in the Travers Stakes in the summer of 1978, their last 
            meeting, after the stewards determined that Affirmed, who was ridden 
            that day by Laffite Pincay Jr., was guilty of interference on the 
            stretch turn. The most comfortable margin of victory in nine of those 
            10 races, the first being the exception, was the 1 ½ lengths by which 
            Affirmed won the Derby.

            Alydar, injured, would be retired soon after the Travers. Affirmed 
            would be defeated by Seattle Slew in the Marlboro Cup that year, the 
            only meeting of Triple Crown winners in history, and conclude a 
            magnificent career with seven consecutive victories as a four-year-old 
            in 1979, defeating the Derby and Preakness winner, Spectacular Bid, 
            to clinch a second Horse of the Year title. Ultimately, Affirmed and
